100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp

Recently I decided to take the 100 Days of Python Course by Angela Yu on Udemy.

Course link: https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/

I took this course to improve my skills in Python, while also building my portfolio.

This repository contains all my notes and projects while trying to complete this course.

Feel free to see my projects and exercises, The finished projects are listed below.

Thanks for visiting this repository!

Course guided projects:
These are my projects from Day 1 - 80, where the course provided a solution for each project. Most of these projects are done by myself, but there are some projects that I finished by taking a peek at the provided solution. Please take note that I have removed most unnecessarily large files that aren't directly related to learning Python.
